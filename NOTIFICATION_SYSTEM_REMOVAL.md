# Notification System Removal

## Overview

The notification system has been removed from the SBPI Management System as part of system simplification and performance optimization efforts. This document explains the changes made and the rationale behind them.

## Files Removed

The following files were removed as part of this change:

1. `frontend/src/components/layout/NotificationCenter.js` - Frontend notification UI component
2. `Backend/models/Notification.js` - Database model for notifications
3. `Backend/controllers/notificationController.js` - Backend controller for notification operations

## Code Updates

The following code updates were made to ensure the system functions properly after the notification system removal:

1. Commented out the notification routes import in `server.js`:
   ```javascript
   // const notificationRoutes = require("./routes/notificationRoutes"); // Removed notification system
   ```

2. Commented out the notification routes middleware in `server.js`:
   ```javascript
   // app.use("/api/notifications", notificationRoutes); // Removed notification system
   ```

3. Removed the NotificationCenter import in `Navbar.js`:
   ```javascript
   // NotificationCenter component has been removed
   ```

## Rationale

The notification system was removed for the following reasons:

1. **Simplification**: The system was being simplified to focus on core functionality.
2. **Performance**: Removing the notification system reduces database queries and improves overall system performance.
3. **Maintenance**: Fewer components means less code to maintain and fewer potential points of failure.
4. **User Experience**: Based on usage analytics, the notification feature was not frequently used by most users.

## Future Plans

If notification functionality is needed in the future, a more streamlined and efficient notification system may be implemented that better integrates with the current architecture and user needs.

## Remaining Notification Features

While the in-app notification system has been removed, email notifications for critical actions like password resets are still maintained in the system. These email notifications are handled directly in the relevant controllers and are not part of the removed notification system.

This change is part of the ongoing system optimization efforts outlined in the NEW_FEATURES_SUMMARY.md document, which focuses on improving operational efficiency and user experience.
